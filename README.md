### App Evaluation

* **Category**: 
    * Productivity / Informative
* **Mobile**: 
    * Reminders for plant care tasks like watering, fertilizing, or pruning make it an indispensable mobile tool. Users can ask the garden guru questions about their plant health. Some stretch features such as using pictures to identify plants could be added as well. Saved guides and plant profiles can be accessed offline, offering on-the-go utility beyond a standard website.
* **Story**:
    * The app solves a common pain point for plant lovers: understanding their plants’ needs. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, personalized advice and reminders make plant care simple. Caring for plants can feel daunting, and the app positions itself as a helpful companion, giving users confidence and fostering success in their plant-care journey.
* **Market**:
    * The app appeals to plant parents, home gardeners, and even educators teaching plant care. People who want an easy way to track and care for their plants will find this app useful.
* **Habit**:
    * While reminders encourage passive use, users actively create content by logging plant details, asking the AI questions, and saving guides. Users will engage with the app daily or weekly for:
        * Checking or updating plant profiles.
        * Logging growth and health status.
Receiving and following care reminders.
* **Scope**:
    * Core features like AI prompts (via GPT API), local data storage, reminders, for plant profiles can be implemented within a month. Stratch features such as Camera-based plant identification or community sharing features can be added if there is additional time left.
